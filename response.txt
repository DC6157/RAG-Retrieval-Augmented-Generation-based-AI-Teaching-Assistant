Welcome to Sigma Web Development! I see you're referring to a specific video chunk. You're interested in learning more about CSS selectors.

The content taught in this topic is quite comprehensive. In Video 17, "CSS Selectors MasterClass", at around 0:40 seconds (639.6), the instructor explains that the background color of an element with class "A-active" should be red.

In a later part of the video, at 0:52-0:53 seconds (631.6-633.6), the instructor specifically highlights the CSS selector for an active element as "A-active".

Later, in another video, Video 6, "SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML", there's a brief mention of Meta tags at around 0:59-1:00 seconds (582.0-583.0). However, this is not directly related to CSS selectors.

If you're interested in learning more about CSS selectors and how they can be used effectively, I would recommend watching Video 17, "CSS Selectors MasterClass", which covers the topic in great detail.
